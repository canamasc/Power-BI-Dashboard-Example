# Power-BI-Dashboard-Example
Most recent example of Power BI Dashboard work

Sensitive/private information is redacted where applicable.

The context of this dashboard is manufacturing process optimization. The 4 main tracked KPIs are 
 - efficiency (how long are we taking to make each unit?)
 - inventory (i.e. WIP = Work in Process) (how much money do we have tied up in inventory?)
 - lead time (how many days is each unit spending in cycle?)
 - quality (what is the average number of defects per unit?)
 - trends / progress (how are each of the above metrics changing over time?)
 - 
For the product line flow cell dashboard, every tile with a numeric or graph value is clickable and leads to a report with additional details on the related metric. The workspace is private to the employer and I am not allowed to share the product name.
